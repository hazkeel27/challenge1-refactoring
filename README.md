# CHALLENGE1-REFACTORING

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to refactor the website to follow the accessibility standards to enhance it for search engine optimization. Some of the concepts I learned while working on this project were semantic HTML elements, logical structure, alt attributes for img tags, sequential headings format, and creating a descriptive title.
